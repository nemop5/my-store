# Client - FE part of the project

When you are running FE side of the project for the first time, make sure you did all the steps below:

1. Add .env variables to the project - You need to create new `.env` file in client folder (similar to `.env.example`). Copy the credentials from the link provided in global README.md file to the .env file created.
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start`

## Running client server

1. Run `npm start` to start react client for the app

NOTE: In case you don't have permissions to see data on the client side, or add new data on the client side, you need to find your user account in database and change your role to `Superadmin`. After that, you need to logout and login to be able to see and modify the data. If you don't know how to do this, ask kindly some BE developer to help you.
