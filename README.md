## To setup the project:
1. Navigate to the my-store folder
2. Run `sudo docker-compose -f ./docker-compose.services.local.yml up`
3. Wait until you see in console: `my_store_node_backend | The app is now available on your browser, follow: http://localhost:3000`
4. It might take a while until you see Listening on port 5000 but be patient
5. Follow the link to use the app http://localhost:3000
6. If you hit any errors you didn't wait for step `3.`, just wait a little bit more...

That's it! Everything is dockerized :D
